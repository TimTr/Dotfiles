# TimTr Dotfiles Documentation

This is the main documentation, beyond the README, for the Dotfiles project.

Honestly, I don't think this project warrants a full set of docs. In many ways, this documentation exists primarily to prove that docs can indeed be auto-generated using GitHub Pages for a very simple repository.


## Table of Contents

`Dotfiles` is covered by the [MIT license](./license-mit.html).
