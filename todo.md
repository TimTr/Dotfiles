# TODO Items


- Rename the dot files to `dot-name.sh` to be more clear (Almost done)
- Add all `update-ruby.sh` functionality into `install-ruby.sh` script
- Copy all scripts and settings into `~/Developer`
- Use a new variable for $HOME/Developer, e.g. $DEVELOPER
- Drive full setup from $DEVELOPER to enable re-run from PATH, not from Dotfiles
- Move the actual dotfiles (e.g. `zshenv`) into subfolder `Root`

## Done

- Move all script files into main `Mac` folder to go into the $PATH
- Put root `~/Developer` in the PATH (remove `./Bin` sub-folder)
