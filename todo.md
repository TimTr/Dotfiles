# TODO Items


- Use a new variable for $HOME/Developer, e.g. $DEVELOPER
- Drive full setup from $DEVELOPER to enable re-run from PATH, not from Dotfiles
    - Using `export DOTFILES_FRESH=1` to indicate a fresh install
- Report current `git config --global user.name "your name"` info (and email) - or instruct how to set it



## Done

- Move all script files into main `Mac` folder to go into the $PATH
- Put root `~/Developer` in the PATH (remove `./Bin` sub-folder)
- Rename the dot files to `dot-name.sh` to be more clear (Almost done)
- Copy all scripts and settings into `~/Developer`
- Add all `update-ruby.sh` functionality into `setup-ruby.sh` script
- Move the actual dotfiles (e.g. `zshenv`) into subfolder `Root`
