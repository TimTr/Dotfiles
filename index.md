# TimTr Dotfiles Documentation

**NOTE:** This is the `index.md` file at root. Update #5 - Feb 22, 3:23pm

This forms the root of the GitHub Pages documentation generated for this repository. It will link over to files within the `./Docs` folder of this repo for the actual documentation.

Link to the [history file](https://timtr.github.io/Dotfiles/Docs/history.html) is here.

Link to the [license file at root](./license.html) is here.

Trying a simple [Link to root README](./readme.html) here.

The [commands file](https://timtr.github.io/Dotfiles/Docs/commands.html) is here.


This is the main documentation for the `Dotfiles` project, beyond the [README](https://timtr.github.io/Dotfiles/) file.

Documentation (or the start of docs) can be [found here](https://timtr.github.io/Dotfiles/docs/). 

**Note:**  the `docs` folder must be in lower-case for GitHub Pages support, if you want to use it as the basis of docs. Capital `Docs` will fail. At present, this repository is setup to use the root of the repo for Pages docs generation, so this `index.md` file manually links to other documentation files.

This project does not really need a full set of docs. In reality, this documentation exists to prove that docs can indeed be auto-generated using GitHub Pages for a very simple repository. Don't expext a lot of great info here, sorry.
