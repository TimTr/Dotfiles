# TimTr Dotfiles Documentation

**NOTE:** This is the `index.md` file at the root

Link to the [license file](https://timtr.github.io/Dotfiles/license.html) is here.

Trying a simpler [[Link to a page]({% link license.md %}) here.

The [readme for Mac](https://timtr.github.io/Dotfiles/Mac/readme-for-mac.html) is here.


This is the main documentation for the `Dotfiles` project, beyond the [README](https://timtr.github.io/Dotfiles/) file.

Documentation (or the start of docs) can be [found here](https://timtr.github.io/Dotfiles/docs/). 

**Note:**  the `docs` folder must be in lower-case for GitHub Pages support. Capital `Docs` will fail.

This project does not justify a full set of docs. In reality, this documentation exists to prove that docs can indeed be auto-generated using GitHub Pages for a very simple repository. Don't expext a lot of great info here, sorry.
