<!-- Sample home page for documentation -->

<html>
<head> <title>Title of the page.</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    This is an example paragraph. Anything in the <strong>body</strong> tag will appear on the page, just like this <strong>p</strong> tag and its contents.
</p>
<p>
    Note that the GitHub Pages reference to the docs must be in the root folder of the repo, or in the lower-case `/docs` folder. A folder name like `/Docs` in upper-case will not generate properly.

<a href="./about.html">Link to the About file (see if this works.)</a>
