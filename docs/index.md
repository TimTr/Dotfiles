#  Dotfiles for TimTr

This is the "Dotfiles" repository I use on my Mac, and will (hopefully soon) be usable for Codespaces when doing work directly on GitHub.com. The documentation is just a work in progress, for now.

Here is a [link to the "About Me"](./about.html) page. Just a place-holder so far.

Thanks for reading.

Signed,
Tim Triemstra - github.com/timtr
